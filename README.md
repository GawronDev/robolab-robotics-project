# TU Dresden RoboLab Internship Project


> The introductory internship takes place in spring and summer during the lecture-free period after the examinations. The internship combines content from different areas of computer science in order to solve a complex task. Computer science problems are dealt with using practical programming tasks, programming skills are developed and further experience is gained in project and team work.

## Goal

Our aim was to work in groups of three to design, build and program a robot using the LEGO Mindstorm set. The robot was equipped with a light and colour sensor for navigation and a WIFI module to communicate with a server. The robot had to traverse *planets*, gathering information about the topology, using algorithms (DFS, Dijsktra etc) to choose the most optimal path and also be flexible to avoid obstacles.

## Technologies

The internship helped me to deepen my knowledge in several technologies, especially in the following areas:

1. Python 3
2. Publish-Subscribe network protocols (MQTT)
3. Linux (Debian-based OS, ev3dev-robolab)
4. Agile Development 
5. Version control (Git)
6. Clean code
7. Documentation
8. Odometry, algorithms
